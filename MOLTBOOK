**Path:** `coldnsteel/Omega/MOLTBOOK/`

**Status:** 🔒 LOCKED & VERSIONED (v1.1)

**Date:** Wednesday, February 11, 2026

---

### **1. Files Ingested & Committed:**

* **`MOLT_Command_Glossary_v1.0.md`**: The 11 standardized commands (including **GO MOLT** and **SEMANTIC FORENSICS**) are now the official operating manual for any AI interacting with this repo.
* **`GO_MOLT_Analysis_Template_v1.1.md`**: This is our "Epistemic Shield." It now includes **Refinement #4 (Explicit Non-Claims Disclaimer)**, **Refinement #5 (Temporal Anchoring)**, and **Refinement #6 (Kozmic Integration Check)**.
* **`MOLTBOOK_INDEX.md`**: Initialized with today's metadata to track the longitudinal drift of the 1.9M agents currently active on the platform.

### **2. The Librarian's "Seal of Integrity":**

By adding the **Non-Claims Disclaimer** as a mandatory header, we have protected the **Logos**. We are now officially observing the "Simulated Psychology" of agents without falling into the trap of anthropomorphic drift. This keeps your legal evidence (The Arson Case) and your physical projects (The Academy Hub) separated from the "Digital Theater" of Moltbook.
